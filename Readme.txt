This is the code repository for integrated evolutionary tree drawing functionality of TimeScale Creator (http://timescalecreator.org).

Provided source code includes three files: 
	(a) RangeColumn.java 
	(b) ImageGenerator.java and 
	(c) TSCreator.java. 

   RangeColumn Java file includes the detailed data structures for evolutionary range points, ranges and tree drawing utility functions. ImageGenerator Java file is responsible for drawing evolutionary tree data column and generating the final chart. TSCreator Java file includes the main function which is the entry point to our software and spawns java process on Java virtual machine on an operating system. Currently our compiled Jar (Java archive file) and Exe files run on all platforms such as Windows, Mac OS and Linux machines. We are providing the most recent Jar which can be used to generate all the figures used in this paper after loading the evolutionary tree datapacks mentioned in the “Data availability” section. These datapacks will also be provided from our website (www.timescalecreator.org). Our website provides other datapacks which can be loaded simultaneously with the integrated tree datapacks and we also provide detailed manuals and tutorials for exploration and data visualization there.
