	Hyracotherium	45.39891786		"Dawn horse (genus Hyracotherium), extinct group of horses that flourished in North America and Europe during the early part of the Eocene Epoch. Even though these animals are more commonly known as Eohippus, a name given by the American paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh, they are properly placed in the genus Hyracotherium, the name given earlier by British paleontologist Richard Owen. The dawn horse was a form close to the common ancestry of all the odd-toed hoofed mammals, the perissodactyls. It stood 30-60 cm (1-2 feet) high at the shoulder, depending on the species. The skull varied in length; some species had a relatively short face, but in others the face was long and more horselike. Since the hind legs were longer than its forelegs, Hyracotherium was adapted to running and probably relied heavily on running to escape predators. The body was lightly constructed and raised well off the ground; its slender limbs were supported by toes held in an almost vertical position. Although four toes were present on the front feet and three on the hind feet, all were functionally three-toed, and each toe ended in a small hoof. The incisors of Hyracotherium were small, and the cheek teeth had low crowns, which indicated the animal was a browser that fed on leaves rather than grass. The dawn horse was succeeded by Orohippus, which differed from Hyracotherium primarily in dentition."

	Orohippus	45.39891786		"In the early to mid Eocene, (about 50 million years ago), the Eohippus slowly transitioned into the Orohippus, meaning ""mountain horse"" although it did not live in the mountains. It was about the same size as Eohippus, but it had a slimmer body, slimmer forelimbs, an elongated neck, and longer hind legs, which are characteristics of a good jumper. Orohippus still had padded feet, but the vestigial outer toes of Eohippus were not present in Orohippus. It had four toes on each fore leg and three each on the hind leg. The most dramatic change between Eohippus and Orohippus was in the teeth: the first premolar teeth were smaller, the last premolar shifted in shape and function into a molar, and the crests on the teeth became more pronounced. All these factors gave the teeth of Orohippus greater grinding ability, which suggests that Orohippus ate tougher plant material."

Epihippus had five grinding, low-crowned cheek teeth with well-formed crests. A late species of Epihippus, sometimes referred to as Duchesnehippus intermedius, had teeth similar to Oligocene equids, although slightly less developed. Whether Duchesnehippus was a subgenus of Epihippus or a distinct genus is disputed. This is an early species of a horse."

	Mesohippus	29.83		"Middle horse' may seem an uninteresting name for a prehistoric horse, but Mesohippus is actually one of the most important. The middle horse name is actually a reference to the position of Mesohippus in relation to earlier forms like Hyracotherium and larger and later forms like we know today. Aside from having longer legs, Mesohippus only had three toes in contact with the ground rather than the four seen in Hyracotherium. The centre toe was the main weight bearing appendage and overall the construction of the foot and larger size reveals that Mesohippus would be the faster horse. By having longer legs, Mesohippus could cover a greater amount of ground during foraging while expending a reduced amount of energy in doing so. However this adaptation may have also been pushed by the emergence of predators such as Hyaenodon and nimravids (false sabre-toothed cats) that would have been too powerful for Mesohippus to fight. As such the best chance that Mesohippus had of staying alive was to quite literally run for its life and try to outpace and outlast its attacker. Unfortunately for Mesohippus this was not always a successful strategy, with fossils revealing that Mesohippus was a prey animal for the aforementioned Hyaenodon. Despite its position lower down on the food chain, Mesohippus was the evolutionary success story as its progeny would go on to become larger and faster running horses, while both predators like Hyaenodon and the nimravids would eventually disappear from the planet without any surviving descendants."

Miohippus evolved from the earlier genus Mesohippus; however, the former was larger and had a more-derived dentition than the latter. The number of toes in Miohippus was reduced to three, which enabled it to run considerably faster than its five-toed ancestors. Miohippus persisted into the Miocene Epoch (23-5.3 million years ago) side by side with its more horselike one-toed relatives. "

	Megahippus	10.3666		"This large horse was a very specialized leaf eater (browser) at a time when most horses were beginning to exclusively eat grass (grazer). Megahippus was the last of the browsing horses in North America. Studies of living hoofed herbivores show that those with wide muzzles usually eat grass, whereas those with narrow snouts tend to eat soft vegetation, like leaves, sprouts, and fruits. Megahippus had a very narrow snout that was used to select rich food items (like fresh sprouting leaves) rather than twigs and old leaves that are not as nutritious. Note here how the front teeth in Megahippus curve strongly in a narrow ""U-shape,"" an adaptation for browsing. Compare it with the broad linear muzzle of Calippus (right), a grazing horse. Megahippus also had low-crowned teeth, so it would have been difficult for it to eat abrasive grass. Grass would have rapidly worn its teeth down. Because Megahippus and other low-crowned ""anchitheres"" were three-toed browsers, they are sometimes considered to have been ""stuck"" in an evolutionary dead-end relative to their grazing contemporaries. They, however, evolved just as rapidly as the grazing horses. The grinding surfaces of their cheek teeth got larger, as did their overall body size. Megahippus, as its name suggests, was a fairly large horse (about 585 pounds) for its time."

	Hypohippus	10.98		"Originally named after a species of Anchitherium, Hypohippus was a primitive three toed horse that browsed upon vegetation rather than grazing on grass. Hypohippus acquired its name from the low middle cusp of its molars. As a browser tthe teeth had proportionately lower crowns than the teeth of grazing horses. Hypohippus would have spent most of its time around wooded areas that had restricted open spaces, something that is in part reflected by legs which are proportionately shorter than the later ""running horses"" that grazed upon the open plains."

	Anchitherium	16.417		Anchitherium was a genus of three toed prehistoric horse that was a browser of plants rather than a grazer of grass. Something that is most easily revealed by the teeth that have much lower crowns than those of known grazing horses. This is also why Anchitherium disappeared without leaving any modern descendants because as the Miocene progressed the coverage of plains environments continued to spread across the globe. This saw Anchitherium faced with an ever decreasing amount of suitable habitat with which it could browse from suitable plants. Meanwhile as this was happening other types of horses that had adapted to take advantage of the expanding grassy plains such as Merychippus thrived.

The genus is considered an example of phyletic dwarfism with adults estimated at being on average 20kg in weight. This is in contrast to the most common equid of the period, Miohippus. Characters of the teeth show a mix of both primitive and advanced traits. "

	Parahippus	15.11		"Parahippus was larger than Miohippus, with longer legs and face. The bones in the legs were fused and this, along with muscle development, allowed Parahippus to move with forward-and-back strides. Flexible leg rotation was eliminated, so that the animal was better adapted to fast forward running on open ground without moving from side to side. Most importantly, Parahippus was able to stand on its middle toe, instead of walking on pads, which gave it the ability to run faster; its weight was supported by ligaments under the fetlock to the big central toe. The side toes were almost vestigial, and seldom touched the ground. Since leafy food had become scarce, these animals were forced to subsist on the newly evolved grasses that were by now taking over the plains, and their teeth adapted accordingly. The extra molar crest that was variable in Miohippus became permanent in Parahippus. The molars developed high crowns and a hard covering for grinding the grass, which was typically covered with high-silica dust and sand."

Merychippus descended from the earlier genus Parahippus. The tooth pattern in Merychippus is basically the same as that in the modern horse; the teeth became higher and dental cement appeared, which allowed a grazing mode of life. Other developments in the skeleton are also evident: its size increased so that Merychippus was almost as large as a modern pony, and the skull became more elongated in a very horselike fashion. The limbs as well became more horselike in proportion and better adapted to running. In some forms the three toes remained comparatively large, but in progressive species of Merychippus the two side toes were short and small. The centre toe was much larger than the others and carried most of the animal's weight. A well-developed hoof was present on the large central toe."

	Neohipparion	6.4808		"Neohipparion was the most successful hipparion horse in terms of number of species in the fossil record. Where & When? Neohipparion fossils are found in sediments dating from the mid-Miocene through early Pliocene of North and Central America. Species in this genus lived from 16 - 5 million years ago. What's so new about Neohipparion? Neohipparion means new better horse Hipparion horses have been found in North America, Europe, and Asia. However, Neohipparion seems to have been strictly a New World genus, hence the ""neo-"" of its name. Neohipparion skull The hipparions were a group of three-toed horses found throughout much of the world during the Miocene and Pliocene. They are distinguished from contemporary non-hipparion horses by the condition of the protocone, a structure in the upper cheekteeth. In hipparions, the protocone and protoloph typically are not connected, whereas in other horses of the late Miocene and Pliocene, they are connected. Hipparions are the most common large mammal in many 10-million-year-old fossil sites. In spite of their success, hipparions were a side branch in horse evolution, with no modern survivors. By 6 million years ago, only a few species remained. The last hipparion species, Cormohipparion emsliei, hung on in Florida until about 2 million years ago."

	Hipparion	6.4808		"Hipparion was one of the earlier grazing horses that was similar to Merychippus in form. Like other ""advanced"" horses of the Miocene, Hipparion supported its body weight upon a single toe that ended with a hoof. Other toes were also still present upon either side of this toe, but they had become so reduced in size that they did not even touch the ground. In later forms like Pliohippus the toes would be virtually absent. The key to fame for Hipparion is the amazing success that this genus exhibited. Although perhaps nothing special in terms of appearance, Hipparion appeared at the start of the Miocene period and continued to thrive until well into the mid Pleistocene, surviving for some twenty-two million years. In the space of this time Hipparion colonised most of the major continents with the exception of Antarctica, Australia and South America. The former two were separated by sea preventing land animals from colonising these continents. South America was not joined to North America until the creation of the Isthmus of Panama in the late Pliocene, and since North American remains of Hipparion are dated to the end of the Miocene at latest, it's probable that Hipparion was not around in this continent at a time to take part in the Great American Interchange which saw a mixing of previously isolated animals, thus missing the chance to colonize South America as well. Hipparion would have been a horse of open plains and steppe, a far cry from its browsing ancestors that would have lurked amongst the bushes hiding from predators. The key adaption that Hipparion had for these habitats were high crowned teeth that were better suited for processing grasses which would have formed the most abundant type of plant that also readily replenished itself."

	Cormohipparion	6.4808		"Cormohipparion ingenuum was the first species of horse to be named from Florida. The species has been referred to many genera over the years. It was initially placed in Hippotherium, a genus first named from Europe, but in the late 1800s it was also widely used for North American hipparion horses (e.g., Cope, 1889). In the 1900s, most paleontologists favored the use of Hipparion instead of Hippotherium, and the species was routinely placed in this genus until 1940 (e.g., Gidley, 1907). In 1940, Nannippus was raised to generic rank and began to be used for smaller North American species previously assigned to Hipparion (e.g., Stirton, 1940). So between 1940 and 1988 the species was usually called Nannippus ingenuus (e.g., MacFadden, 1984). Finally, in 1988, it was assigned to the genus Cormohipparion, and made the type species of a new subgenus, Notiocradohipparion (Hulbert, 1988). So its full, formal scientific name is Cormohipparion (Notiocradohipparion) ingenuum (Leidy, 1885)."

Pliohippus, the earliest one-toed horse, evolved from Merychippus, a three-toed horse of the preceding Miocene Epoch (23-5.3 million years ago). The teeth of Pliohippus are taller and more complexly folded than those of earlier horses; these features indicate a greater dependence on grazing than browsing for food. Because of its diet and its specializations for running, it is likely that Pliohippus lived on open plains."

Dinohippus is considered to have been very close to the modern horse genus Equus, and like modern horses, Dinohippus lacked a dished face. Dinohippus was once considered to have been an exclusively monodactyl horse, but some fossil evidence has now revealed that a few individuals were tridactyl, possibly indicating that the monodactyl/tridactyl development was dependent more upon the species as opposed to a hard and fast rule about the genus. The legs and feet of Dinohippus are also formed in such a way that Dinohippus could stand for extended periods of time with only the bare minimum of energy expenditure. It is for these features that many people have considered Dinohippus to be the immediate ancestor to modern horses.

	Hippidion	1		"Hippidion is one of the first known horses to actually enter South America, but interestingly while it has been regarded as being directly descended from primitive forms such as Pliohippus, more modern analysis actually draws a link to the Equidae, the group that includes modern horses. One thing that makes Hippidion stand out from its North American relatives is the delicately domed nasal bone which likely allowed for an enlarged nasal area. This has been suggested as allowing for an increased sense of smell, although this would be a very curious adaptation for a herbivore to make, especially for a grazing animal. It is more likely that this enlarged nasal system was a climatic adaptation since Hippidion would have been living in ecosystems where the air was both cold and dry. By passing the air through a set of enlarged and possibly more complex air passages before reaching the lungs, Hippidion could beat the cooling effects of the chill air as well as significantly reduce the amount of moisture lost through respiration. With the lungs protected from drying out, Hippidion would then avoid having to deal with the ailments associated with long term exposure to dry air. Hippidion is estimated to have died out at some point around the last ten thousand years, a time that saw much of the other South American megafauna disappear. This disappearance coincides with the arrival of the first people in South America and hunting may have been a significant factor in the decline of the South American megafauna at this time, although perhaps not the single root cause of this mass extinction. The next wave of horses to colonise South America would not happen till the sixteenth century when they were brought over by European explorers."

Recent genetic work on fossils has found evidence for only three genetically divergent equid lineages in Pleistocene North and South America. These results suggest all North American fossils of caballine-type horses (which also include the domesticated horse and Przewalski's horse of Europe and Asia), as well as South American fossils traditionally placed in the subgenus E. (Amerhippus) belong to the same species: E. ferus. Remains attributed to a variety of species and lumped as New World stilt-legged horses (including E. francisci, E. tau, E. quinni and potentially North American Pleistocene fossils previously attributed to E. cf. hemiones, and E. (Asinus) cf. kiang) probably all belong to a second species endemic to North America, which despite a superficial resemblance to species in the subgenus E. (Asinus) (and hence occasionally referred to as North American ass) is closely related to E. ferus. Surprisingly, the third species, endemic to South America and traditionally referred to as Hippidion, originally believed to be descended from Pliohippus, was shown to be a third species in the genus Equus, closely related to the New World stilt-legged horse. The temporal and regional variation in body size and morphological features within each lineage indicates extraordinary intraspecific plasticity. Such environment-driven adaptative changes would explain why the taxonomic diversity of Pleistocene equids has been overestimated on morphoanatomical grounds. According to these results, it appears the genus Equus evolved from a Dinohippus-like ancestor ~4-7 mya. It rapidly spread into the Old World and there diversified into the various species of asses and zebras. A North American lineage of the subgenus E. (Equus) evolved into the New World stilt-legged horse (NWSLH). Subsequently, populations of this species entered South America as part of the Great American Interchange shortly after the formation of the Isthmus of Panama, and evolved into the form currently referred to as Hippidion ~2.5 million years ago. Hippidion is thus unrelated to the morphologically similar Pliohippus, which presumably became extinct during the Miocene. Both the NWSLH and Hippidium show adaptations to dry, barren ground, whereas the shortened legs of Hippidion may have been a response to sloped terrain. In contrast, the geographic origin of the closely related modern E. ferus is not resolved. However, genetic results on extant and fossil material of Pleistocene age indicate two clades, potentially subspecies, one of which had a holarctic distribution spanning from Europe through Asia and across North America and would become the founding stock of the modern domesticated horse. The other population appears to have been restricted to North America. One or more North American populations of E. ferus entered South America ~1.0-1.5 million years ago, leading to the forms currently known as E. (Amerhippus), which represent an extinct geographic variant or race of E. ferus, however."
